                        During my time at Walmart, I was given the opportunity to develop my skills in Angular by creating a to-do app. 
                        I decided to give this to-do app the name Take Action! and use it not only to grow in my skills but also to create 
                        a tool I and others would later find useful. The resulting application allows a user to create, edit, complete or 
                        delete actions (tasks) and apply categorization. To give the user a feeling of accomplishment I also included a 
                        time chart that tracks how many actions are completed in a given day. The picture on the right is a screenshot of 
                        my application after a few days of use (potentially sensitive information has been blocked out).<br></br><br></br>

                        This application was an invaluable learning experience that contributed directly to the skills I used in my job as 
                        a Software Engineer. Before beginning the job my only other experience with Angular was during an internship. I like 
                        how the Angular framework divides an application into components and services. One of my coworkers explained the 
                        components as the Lego building blocks of an application. Each component has a specific function and contains both the 
                        user interface design of the element and the code logic. Services control the input and flow of information throughout 
                        the application.<br></br><br></br>

                        While the purpose of this application was to focus on learning Angular, for the first time I learned how to create an 
                        API (Application Programming Interface) using ExpressJS! Although I did spend some time designing the application 
                        before developing it, I was mainly focused on the frontend, which later led to complications and the need to rework 
                        the backend multiple times. For my next application I will spend more time designing it rather than jumping into the 
                        code. üòÇ<br></br><br></br><br></br>
