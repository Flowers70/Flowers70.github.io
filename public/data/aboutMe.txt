As an aspiring Computer Scientist with experience in full stack development, I am eager to help others through the application of my knowledge. I enjoy the challenge of continuous learning due to rapidly evolving technologies. Having graduated from John Brown University in December 2024 and three months of experience in my first corporate job I am excited to explore the many doors that open as I grow in expertise. Due to a recent elimination of my position, I have been laid off, however, I look forward to seeing how God will use this moment to bless others. As of now, I am looking for an opportunity to apply my technical skills and gain invaluable insights from experienced individuals. I appreciate the time you have taken to read this and hope you have a great day!
